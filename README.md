# WeedsDetectNet
Accurate weed detection is crucial for precision agriculture and green crop protection. Existing methods often struggle with high recognition errors, particularly in complex environments where weeds share similar colors and shapes. This paper presents WeedsDetectNet, an improved YOLOv5n model for weed detection.
